splunk search assistant can fuzzy match what you're looking for


searches
    search string input
    time range selector

search for string (value) can match for anything applicable
503 value can return possibly
    - status 503,
    - user 503,
    - ../pinapple/503.php

so to restrict , use key/value pairs.

splunk will try and match k's and v's and provide this list for you via search assistant.

To search for multiple kv's, use booleans:
    - OR - AND - NOT

if no boolean is used, AND is implied.

comparison operators can also be used.
