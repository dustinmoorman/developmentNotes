- splunk adds an "AND" in between all string tokens being searched for.

- no default expression matching
    - you'll need a * to match

- pipe-able data to function capabilities


check_clou* | search 193324


- by default not sequential

pipe to sort -_time to get ordered results

_time is special, the minus (-) is sort by descending order, while sans (-) is ascending

Splunk will do realtime event tracking
    - it will be heavy request-wise

rex (regular expression eXtraction)

| rex "Time elapsed: (?<elapsed>[0-9.]*)" | table _time elapsed

also _time elapsed _raw

eval elapsed = (elapsed/60). " minutes"

| transaction id

group events together ^ 

| transaction id duration eventcount
    - how many events are in a given grouping

before piping to the transaction method, you need to filter out as much as possible to make it quicker and alleiviate the slowness

| stats count

- allows you to filer by field

| stats count by process_id

Stats for the count on how many times this process_id was logged ^

adding filter to count

| stats count(process_id) by trans_id

- filter out how many times a process occurs in a set of transactions

stdev(elapse) can get you a column with the standard deviation of the above elapsed definition (eval)


| chart avg(elapsed) by process_id

splunk cant graph 3 dimensionally, only 2 axes

break out other: 
useother=f limit=0

you always want time to be the x axis

timechart can be used in lieu of chart to build charts with time as an axis


| timechart count by host

| timechart span=5m count by host

you can save searches, and by doing so schedule those search results

you can save either a graph based on relative time, or
you can save a specified resultset

sparkline - time per field and plots out how many events have occurred in a time frame
 - useful for noticing trends

| stats sparkline(count)

splunk will allow 10 concurrent searches at a time
    - per logged in user
    - then it will start queueing
