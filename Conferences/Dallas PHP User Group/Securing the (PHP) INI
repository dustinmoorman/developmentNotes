----------------------------------------------

Covering behind the scenes stuff that tutorials don't tell you about.

php.ini - the config file

- there can be other config files though.


stuff in there
-base php settings
-apc cache control
-cgi
-cli setup
- exif
-date timeaa
-file upload
-phar
-pdo
-soap connections
-sessions
-xdebug
-http requests
-memcache
-sql dbs

php.ini location can be configured.

read on startup

multiple can exist

only some can be overwritten

- too many people ignore it.

If you don't have an INI file in the fs, PHP will load its 'default' internal one.

Be careful not to change things that are harmful to your system.

Don't set memory to 6G unless you need to! If anon found out, they could spawn multiple apache threads and could take that server down pretty easily.

Main points
-base php settings
-err handling
-file uploads
- http req
-sessions


Base PHP
------------
display_errors = off

Can spew out all kinds of info, turn this off.

* can even leave this off in devel and just tail the logs

log_errors = ON

Always log errors that occur

error_reporting = E_ALL

Throw every single type of error.

- Development settings.
- Production - use NOTICE and below.

display_startup_errors = OFF

doesn't really come up anymore, usually its the execution of the code that causes problems. stuff that comes up before the script processes even.
