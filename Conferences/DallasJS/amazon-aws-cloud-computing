Cloud computing has turned computing into a utility.

(Video Stephen Fry Explains Cloud Computing - a must watch)

20% of the top technology companies have moved to virtualizing.

high emphasis on pay per use 

Treat servers as cattle, not pets

pets are 
- cutely named
- unique, special, cared for
- taken care of when ill

cattle are
- called by numbers,
- replaced when ill,
- you need more, you buy more

Automate, dont document.
- automate network creation
- installation of software
- error detection
- error handling

AWS 
- largest provider
- streamlined interface
- most mature automation.......... for NOW!
- features

Architecting for AWS

3 step process
---------------
1 replace tiers with AWS services
2 secure
3 leverage elasticity

the evolution phase

those who find cloud "expensive" or "not for them" are in the first tier of cloud integration.

Worry list
-----------
- Db backup
- Asset backup
- Web uptime
- App uptime
- DB uptime
- Static page uptime
- traffic spikes
- DoS attacks
- Security breach


DoS attacks - Amazon will ban attacking IPs if a DoS attack is detected.

NoSQL - DynamoDB
Queuing - SQS (Simple Queue Service)
Caching - Elasticache
page caching - Cloudfront ('varnish')

Key features are high availability and redundancy of data.

RDS - MySQL, restricted to a GUI, but the application will be available to port 3306.

Amazon manages RDS. Same for Elasticache.

CloudFront - page caching and CDN. In the same dashboard as the rest of the infrastructure, so it makes integration easy. Cloudflare is a good alternative.

Page level caching is one of the most underrated features in web development, and Cloudfront costs very low per month, relatively high traffic websites will have a cloudfront bill in the $1.50 range/mo.
	- you pay by storage, its $1/gb a month.

Caching is very cost effective if most pages are served by CloudFront, usage costs of a web server are reduced.

Openstack Swift is a good S3 alternative.

Amazon RDS
- MySQL
- Postgres
- SQL Server
- Oracle

SQL server being the weakest implementation within RDS.

Cloudfront (think varnish)
- geographically distributed.

Elasticache
- in-memory caching tier for your app
- spin up with a single click
- redis and memcached are available
- high availability

S3
- high availability
- fast

DynamoDB
-NoSQL as a service

Route53 - amazon dns server
SNS - server to server and server to man communication
SQS - on demand queuing service
SWF - simple workflow
