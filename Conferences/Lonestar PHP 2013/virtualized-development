Lonestar PHP 2013
Virtualized Development

Local dev setup is a drag

-apache
-mysql
-php
-blar blar blar

Multiple projects are harder to set up.

Takes effort.

It needs to mirror production.

You can have the comfort then, if things are working locally, you can assume they'd work in production.*



*subject to change without notice ;)

REPLICATING BUGS

- you can do it easily with a mirrored environment.

EVERYTHING STILL BREAKS

- some idiosyncracies can exist

Need to Automate

Vagrant

Building VMs

Rubygem for managing virtual machines

Shares a folder locally.

No need to deploy.

Feels local.

No speed delay, etc.

It's really a headless VM

VagrantFile - defines the basebox.
-defines port numbers.
-defines shared folders.

- you can actually store that part of your application in your VCS. 

Installing Vagrant

gem install vagrant
