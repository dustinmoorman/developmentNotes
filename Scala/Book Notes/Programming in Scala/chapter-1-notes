A Scalable Language

The name Scala stands for "Scalable Language", the language is thus named because it was designed to grow with the demands of its users.

- Scala runs on the standard Java platform, and interoperates seamlessly with all Java libraries.
- It's good for scripts that pull together Java components.
- Better for building large systems and frameworks of reusable components.

Scala is a blend of OOP and Functional Programming concepts in a statically typed language.

(the ultimate hybrid)

The combination of both paradigms in Scala make it possible to express new kinds of programming patterns and component abstractions. It also fosters a legible and concise programming style.

Maps in Scala are not language syntax, they are library abstractions that you can extend and adapt.
