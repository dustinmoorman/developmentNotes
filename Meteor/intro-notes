Meteor notes!

== What is Meteor?

two things:

	- A lib of prewritten packages, self-contained modules that you might need in a realtime app. Several included toolsets of functionality you might use in any app running with meteor. (Ex - webapp, templating, email / Meteor Account series - account-password, accounts-facebook)


	- A command line tool called `meteor`, which is a build tool like make or rake, or the internals of Visual Studio. Carries out any necessary build steps like package fetching or building npm modules.


The goal of Meteor is that everything should work identically in the browser and on the server. (Wherever it should work identically and make sense.)
