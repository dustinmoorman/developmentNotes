Oracle Statistics
    - instance level statistics (awr, statspack)
        - too little detail => stop short of complete diagnosis
        - can be collected automatically
            - (passive)
    - trace level statistics (sql_trace)
        - too much detail => intrusive, hard to see big picture
        - must be enabled manually
        - need prior knowledge that problem exists
            - (reactive)

Solution: Active Session History
    - Sample session activity in the system including:
        - session id
        - wait event
        - sql id
        - object
    - always on for first fault analysis (passive)

Active session history
    - Sampled, detailed, non-intrusive activity data
    - part of 10g
    - on by default
    - licensed as part of the diagnostic pack
    
    - Samples 'Active' sessions every second
        - like doing "select * from v$session_wait" w/o sql
    - Writes into ASH buffer in SGA memory
        - 2MB per CPU, <= 5% shared_pool, 2% sga_target
    - 'Active' == Non-idle sessions
        - waiting on non-idle event or on CPU
    - Data volume based on activity
        - 10k sessions => 200 active sessions
        - oracle design goal: one hour activity in memory



-- size of the ash buffer
select * from v$sgastat where name like 'ASH buffers';

POOL        NAME        BYTES

-- sample time window
select min(sample_time), max(sample_time) from v$active_session_history;
