Oracle Statistics
    - instance level statistics (awr, statspack)
        - too little detail => stop short of complete diagnosis
        - can be collected automatically
            - (passive)
    - trace level statistics (sql_trace)
        - too much detail => intrusive, hard to see big picture
        - must be enabled manually
        - need prior knowledge that problem exists
            - (reactive)
