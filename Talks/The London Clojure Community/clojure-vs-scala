What is Scala?

Java without semi-colons...

	- with a more extensive type-system
	- an improved compiler
	- lambdas
	- enhanced-collection features
	- "actors"

implementations of actors

	- actors in the language
	- library actors "akka"

Tools

	sbt			lein2
	Scalatest		??? (hammocks)
	Intellij		Light Table/Emacs

Community

Clojurians love LISP
	or can learn to love it

Scala people hate Java
	and can't get over it

(LoL)


Scala - Object Oriented, with functional principles.

Repl versus shell

(use :reload 'blah.core)			A shell requires 
						recompilation to
						reflect changes
						(~console)

Mix scratch and file code		Gain insight into what
Move between the two			the code does

Live in REPL, vist the Shell

Type hinting versus inference

There when needed			Necessarily intrusive

(defin foo [^int x]			def foo(Int x) : Int
	(inc x))				=> x + 1
