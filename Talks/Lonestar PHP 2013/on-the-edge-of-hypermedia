On the Edge of Hypermedia

Richardson Maturity Model

					Glory of REST
Level 3: Hypermedia Controls		^
Level 2: HTTP Verbs			||
Level 1: Resources			||
Level 0: Swamp of POX (plain old XML)	||


REST is an overloaded term

1. client - server
2. stateless
iii. Cacheable
four. layered system
v. Uniform Interfaces
6. Code on Demand (optional)

DNS does the name translation like an address book / phone.

REST is NOT a standard

REST = "Gentelemens Agreement"

SOAP is like getting a mortgage 

- a bunch of info up front
- multiple people involved
- stakeholders
-something happens at the end of it


REST is like "Hey bro, can I borrow a dolla?"

"Strictly RESTful" Lolololololololooooo

REST is NOT

- Pretty URLS
- XML over HTTP
- JSON over HTTP

RESOURCES === NOUNs

Identification of Resources

Generally
- /noun/id
- /noun/action/id


Collections too...

Generally
- /nouns
- /nouns?page=n&limit=100

Manipulation through those interfaces

GET - retrieve something
POST - create something
PUT - update something

GET - theoretically idempotent.

Uniform Interfaces
- 4 principles
	- identification of resources
	- manipulation of resources through these representations
	- self descriptive messages
	- HATEOAS

Clients make state transitions only through actions that are dynamically identified within hypermedia by the server. Except for simple fixed entry points to the application, a client does not assume that any particular actions will be available for any particular resources beyond those described in representations previously received from the server.


ACTION ITEMS:
Accepting REST calls

Levels 0, 1, and 2, are pretty well defined.

Hypermedia controls is another story.
