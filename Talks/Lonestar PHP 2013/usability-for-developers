Usability for Developers
Beth Tucker Long

Usability - the ease of use and learnability of a human-made object.

What will happen when a user finds your site and it's difficult to use?

They will not come back.

Where to start - 

Who are your users?
What do you want them to do on the website?
What do THEY want to do on your website?
How tech-savvy are your users?
Where will your users go if your site isn't working for them?

Once you have a design.

1. Learnability - is it easy to learn?
2. Efficiency - can they quickly do what they want to do?
3. Memorability - how easily can a user reestablish proficiency?
4. Errors - How many errors can a user make, how severe, how can they recover?
5. Satisfaction - How pleasant is it to use the design?


Common problems to avoid

-know your user and you are not that user
-dont overwhelm the users
-consistency is key!
-minimize the need for a mighty memory

Don't make them think, design ergonomically.

Make sure kickbacks store good information.

- make the user process easy

in kick backs, highlight fields that Do need to be updated.


Keep consistent. Especially with link colors, make things that look the same act the same.
Make things that act different look different.

Avoid company lingo with products (internal language). Sell it to your customer by what they're looking for. 

(Ex, don't say 12" pizza, 18" pizza; Call it Small and Medium)

How to test

- create personas
- create a script/list of the most common procedures or tasks on your site
- identify success criteria
- sit down with users individually and give them one task at a time

What to test?

- old design: the old design is what the users are used to.
- competitors website
- sites popular with your users
- proposed site

FaceBook

Facebook is teaching your users how to use the internet!!!!

(so dam true)
