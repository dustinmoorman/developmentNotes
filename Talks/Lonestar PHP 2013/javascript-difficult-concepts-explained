JavaScript's difficult concepts explained
Jeff Carouth

goal:

Reduce the wat factor

Global variables---

foo = "I am a global scoped variable"

Function scope

function sayFoo(){
	console.log(foo);
	//JS will look in the current scope 
	//if the variable is not found there, 
	//it'll hop up into the global scope.
}

in javascript, to understand context, to know how `this` is represented - it depends on how this function was called.

You don't always control how your code is being called.

the this keyword, and the context of the function depend entirely on how the function was invoked.

"Default context"

What context exists by default?

- global context

and then there's 

- method context

you must learn the prototype chain to understand javascript's prototypal inheritance model


"HERE BE DRAGONS"

1. Avoid using global vars inside function scope!
2. Context and `this` blar blar... too slow on the note taking
