Modern HTTP Architecture

reveal.js

Web/HTTP

Theory,

each application is unique and has its own challenges.

Traditional Architecture

request <----> internet <-----> application server

Modern Architecture

request <-----> internet <-----> reverse proxy
				-a -a -a -a -application server

Easy to scale

Efficient scaling?

One application server

- if part goes down, the rest does too under one app serv
- having shit spread out allows things to fail and it be ok if they are components.

Multi device world

internet enabled tv <-----------> internet <------> reverse proxy
smartphone <----------------/			-a -a -a -a -application server
tablet <--------------------/

Small, simple, working together.

Having an image processor application, that's all it does.
Having a commenting application, that's all it does.

THIS IS IMPORTANT!!!!

"Write programs that do one thing, and do it well. Write programs to work together,
Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface."

Modernize it!

"Write WEB SERVICES that do one thing, and do it well. Write WEB SERVICES to work together,
Write WEB SERVICES to handle JSON data, because that is a universal interface." 

What's it look like?

App Server
------------------------------------.
User Auth		Sessions     |
Content			Random Models|
-------------------------------------'


Now it's all modules that talk between each other.

Service Oriented Architecture

"Enterprise" lolz

If you've written your own database or cache server, you've done this.

Start thinking about your code that way


Replace services at will

Use the right tool for the job.

Scale Services Separately!!!!!


If you scale them together it's not as easy, it takes more planning.

HaaS

HTML AS A SERVICE

take the application layer and replace it with something that is an HTML service

ACTION ITEMS:

Varnish
Nginx

Implement and use this technology.
