When to refactor?

No special time, do it in short bursts.

Rewrite vs refactor

Reasons to NOT rewrite
	- budget
	- time
	- retain business logic

Rewrite = lazy way to avoid bad code (perceived)
Refactor = best teacher

Rewrite dilemma, vicious circle of HELL!

As you're refactoring, dont worry about optimization. 

Refactoring will show you where your bottlenecks are.

Don't mix refactoring and optimization, do one, then the other.

After the code is flexible and decoupled, OPTIMIZE!


RECAP

Do not refactor a broken application
Always have tests in place prior to refactoring
leave code cleaner than you got it
try NOT to rewrite
Learn to "smell" problems
Love iteration!
